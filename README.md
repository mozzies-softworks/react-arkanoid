# React Arkanoid

A classic Arkanoid-style brick-breaker game built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. A fun, retro-inspired browser game with a modern tech stack and a neon aesthetic.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to destroy all the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the ball.

1.  **Start the Game:** Click on the game screen to begin.
2.  **Control the Paddle:** Move your mouse left and right within the game area to control the paddle at the bottom of the screen.
3.  **Bounce the Ball:** Keep the ball in play by bouncing it off the paddle. If the ball drops below the paddle, you will lose a life.
4.  **Break the Bricks:** Each time the ball hits a brick, the brick is destroyed, and you earn 10 points.
5.  **Win the Game:** Clear all the bricks from the screen to win!
